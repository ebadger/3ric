# 3ric — ROM & Software Spec (ROM-SOFTWARE.md)

> The 512 KB system ROM (monitor, DOS shell, BASIC), the character/font ROM, and the 6502
> programs that run on 3ric. This is the software the CPU actually executes; the emulator
> (`EMULATOR.md`) and hardware (`HARDWARE.md`) exist to run it.

## Purpose

Provide the machine's firmware and application software: power-on monitor, a FAT32 DOS
shell, Microsoft BASIC, and a growing library of 65C02 programs (games, demos) that load
from a micro-SD card, a Disk II floppy, or the in-browser assembler.

## Contracts / Interfaces

- **System ROM:** `emulator/Data/badger6502.bin` (512 KB; first 64 KB mapped `$D000–$FFFF`
  plus banked regions). Contains the monitor, the DOS/FAT32 shell, the Disk II boot PROM
  (`$C600`), and Microsoft BASIC (`$9000–$BFFF`). Reset vector at `$FFFC/$FFFD`. Built with
  cc65/ca65; debug symbols in `badger6502.dbg` (consumed by `codegen/gen_platform_ref.mjs`).
- **Font ROM:** `emulator/Data/fontrom.dat`, loaded by the text renderer.
- **ROM entry points (contract for programs; curated in `codegen/platform/platform-ref.*`):**
  `COUT $FDED`, `COUT1 $FDF0`, `CROUT $FD8E`, `PRBYTE $FDDA`, `HOME $FC58`, `KEYIN $FD1B`;
  DOS shell `dos $EC5C` (mount + `>` prompt), verbs `BSAVE/BLOAD/BRUN/DIR/CAT/CD`, FAT32
  `fat32_file_read/write`.
- **`.PRG` programs:** assembled by the codegen toolchain (`CODEGEN.md`). Sources: tracked
  `.s` files (`codegen/programs/hello.s`, `emulator/AICodeGen/<name>/<name>.s`); assembled
  `.prg` images are git-ignored (regenerated). Run on hardware/SD via `BRUN NAME.PRG <org>`,
  or in the browser via **Load .PRG** / **Assemble & Run**.
- **Disk & card images:** demo `.woz` (staged from `emulator/WozFileTestApp/testdata/`);
  `emulator/Data/sd.zip` → `web/data/sd.sparse` FAT32 image (`WEB-CLIENT.md`).

## Behaviour / Rules

- **Known limitation — no Applesoft.** The `$E000` BASIC is generic Microsoft BASIC (prompts
  `MEMORY SIZE?`). Disks whose boot auto-runs an Applesoft greeting (DOS 3.3 / Quick-DOS
  System Masters and games chaining through them) load DOS but then trap. Self-booting
  machine-code disks run fine. Treat this as a documented gap, not a bug to paper over.
- **The ROM defines the memory-map contract in practice.** ROM routines assume the `MM_*`
  layout in `vm.h`; a memory-map change means rebuilding/re-verifying the ROM and
  regenerating `platform-ref.*`.
- 6502 sources target the `asm6502.mjs` dialect and conventions in
  `codegen/platform/prompt-system.md`.

## Data flow

`badger6502.bin → mapped $D000–$FFFF + banks; reset → monitor → (Disk II C600G | DOS EC5CG |
BRUN) → user program runs → COUT/screen/serial output`.

## Dependencies

- **Upstream:** the assembler/build (cc65/ca65 for the ROM; `CODEGEN.md` for programs).
- **Downstream:** the emulator loads and executes it (`EMULATOR.md`); the platform reference
  is derived from its symbols (`CODEGEN.md`).

## Implementation Status

| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| System ROM (monitor / DOS shell / FAT32) | Shipped | `badger6502.bin`; boots to monitor. |
| Microsoft BASIC | Shipped | `$9000–$BFFF`; not Applesoft (known gap). |
| Font ROM | Shipped | `fontrom.dat`. |
| Disk II boot PROM | Shipped | `$C600`; boots self-booting WOZ images. |
| 6502 program library | Ongoing | `codegen/programs/`, `emulator/AICodeGen/` (games/demos). |
